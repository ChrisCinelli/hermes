Changes 

* Dec 3rd, 2012 - Bumped project number to 0.2.3. Whenever a key of an
  object is returned, it must be a keyword. Likewise, whenever a
  collection is returned by a function it must be a clojure
  collection, i.e. PersistentHashSet instead of HashSet. Tests have
  been updated to reflect this. 
* Dec 3rd, 2012 - Started change log with version 0.2.2.
