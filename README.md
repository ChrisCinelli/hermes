# Hermes

A Clojure library designed to make it easy to work with embedded [Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/) graphs. 

Check [clojars](https://clojars.org/hermes) for the latest jar. The best thing to do is set up lein checkouts and clone the library directly. 

This is very much a work in progress. Titan is a young project and has
yet to even hit 0.2. Hermes will probably always be a work in progress
until Titan hits 1.0. So, use this in production at your own peril.

The best bet right now is to read the source code. We are still writing the docs and example projects.
