# Hermes

A Clojure library designed to make it easy to work with embedded
[Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/) graphs. To get
started, add this dependency to your `project.clj`:

``` clojure
[hermes "0.2.2"]
```

Take a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/gameclosure/hermes/wiki)
for information about Hermes. Try the [Getting
Started](https://github.com/gameclosure/hermes/wiki/Getting-Started)
page if you are in the mood for barrelling through an example.

Titan is a young project and has yet to hit 0.2. Hermes will probably
always be a "work in progress" until Titan hits 1.0. With all that in
mind, we've created a solid set of tests that encapsulates everything
we want Hermes to do right now. While we don't know all of the myriad
changes that will for sure come to both Hermes and Titan in the
future, we do know that both pieces of software seem to work as
intended right now.

what looks to be a somewhat active physics discussion happening back
in 2007.
