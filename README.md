# Hermes

A Clojure library designed to make it easy to work with embedded
[Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/) graphs. Hermes is very
much a work in progress. Titan is a young project and has yet to even
hit 0.2. Hermes will probably always be a work in progress until Titan
hits 1.0. So, while we have tested this and used it in production 
ourselves, in general use this in production at your own peril.

To get started, add this dependency to your `project.clj`:

``` clojure
[hermes "0.2.2"]
```

Yell at [Zack](http://www.twitter.com/ZackMaril) if it breaks. Sometimes, we take over #hermes 
on freenode, an old IRC channel that used to have what looks to be a somewhat active physics 
discussion happening back in 2007.
